# Feature branch + pull request flow

## Create a feature branch
git checkout -b my_feature
... do some work, add commits

## Create a pull_request 0 branch from the current tip of my_feature
git checkout -b pull_requests/my_feature/0
git push --set-upstream origin pull_requests/my_feature/0

# Cleanup stale remote branches
git fetch
git remote prune origin
